## 📌 Project Overview

**SE Limited Edition Fashion (Sagaa Elite)** is a drop-based, limited-edition fashion e-commerce website developed using the **MERN stack**.

The platform is designed for a Sri Lankan startup clothing brand that focuses on **unisex streetwear**, exclusivity, and emotional brand connection rather than traditional mass-market categories.

Instead of standard product categories, SE follows a **Drop Selling Model**, where each collection is released in limited quantities and archived once sold out.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a modern e-commerce platform for a fashion startup
- Implement drop-based product releases (no fixed categories)
- Provide real-time stock updates for limited-edition items
- Develop a secure admin panel for product and order management
- Ensure a responsive and premium user experience
- Use industry-standard MERN stack technologies

## 🧠 Core Concept: Drop-Based Selling

- No traditional categories (Men / Women / Accessories)
